* Introduction

  This minor mode provides some nice project related facilities. For
  make them work it looks for your .dir-locals.el file and considers
  that as the project's root (You can also specify the project root by
  setting the `projutils-project-root-path' variable).

  Currently it implements:

   + File browser from project's root.
   + Grep/Ack from project's root.
   + Find file in project.

* Requirements

  This package was tested with GNU/Emacs 23 only, it should work with
  others versions too but I can't ensure anything. Besides from that
  nothing else is required.

  Recommended optional requirements are `full-ack' and `sr-speedbar'.

* Installation/Usage

  Add this to your .emacs:

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/folder/containing/file")
  (require 'projutils)
  (projutils-global-mode 1)
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  Browse project files from root folder: Using speedbar or, if
  available, sr-speedbar.  In the case both are present you can
  control if sr-speedbar should have precedence via the
  `projutils-use-sr-speedbar' variable.

  Grep files from the root folder: Using rgrep or, if available, ack
  (from full-ack package).  In the case both are present you can
  control if ack should have precedence via the `projutils-use-ack'
  variable.

  Find file in project: The list of files is generated from the
  project root and you can control what should be filtered by setting
  the `projutils-ffip-ignored-dirs', `projutils-ffip-ignored-files',
  `projutils-ffip-allowed-file-extensions',
  `projutils-ffip-ignored-file-extensions',
  `projutils-ffip-ignored-regexps' variables.
